        <h2>Main principles</h2>
        <p>The algorithm knows hundreds of rules - stylistic, typographic, and just best practices. For the spell check you should rely on your text editor and other services. Below are the main guiding principles:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Don't hype. Avoid words like novel, highly, clearly, greatly. Better still, avoid all adverbs.</li>
        <li>Don't use clich√©s. In a nutshell, by and large, they are clear as mud.</li>
        <li>Don't use "very" very often. Usually, there is a better word for it.</li>
        <li>Be concise. Avoid phrases like "by means of, despite the fact that, in order to".</li>
        <li>Avoid negatives. For example, use "unable" instead of "not able".</li>
        <li>Avoid redundancy. For example, use "investigate" instead of "conduct an investigation of".</li>
        <li>Use active voice. Although not always possible, most of the text should be in active voice.</li>
        <li>Avoid inappropriate language. Keep words like "really, actually, pretty much" for social networks.</li>
        <li>Avoid rare words and latinisms. Non credo all readers know the meaning.</li>
        <li>Keep abbreviations to minimum. Abbreviations are hard to read, consider just spelling it out.</li>
        <li>Beware of zombie nouns. Utilization of nominalization is causation of distraction.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beside these and many smaller rules, Angry Reviewer checks for typical typographic mistakes, references, chemical elements, abbreviations and other details.</p>
