        <p>The rules used by Angry Reviewer are based on various journal guidelines, articles, books, and lectures on modern academic writing. But, the main source is the book <i>The Craft of Scientific Writing</i> by Michael Alley. The alghorithm knows hundreds of rules, most of which are stylistic. For the spell check you should rely on your text editor and other services.</p>
        <h2>Main priciples</h2>
        <ul>
        <li> <i>Don't hype.</i> Avoid words like novel, highly, clearly, greatly. Better still, avoid all adverbs.</li>
        <li> <i>Don't use clich√©s.</i> Avoid overused expressions like holy grail, paradigm shift, in a nutshell.</li>
        <li> <i>Don't use "very" very often.</i> Usually, there is a better word for it.</li>
        <li> <i>Be concise.</i> Avoid phrases like <i>by means of, despite the fact that, in order to</i>.</li>
        <li> <i>Avoid negatives.</i> For example, use "unable" instead of "not able".</li>
        <li> <i>Avoid redundancy.</i> For example, use "investigate" instead of "conduct an investigation of".</li>
        <li> <i>Use active voice.</i> Although not always possible, most of the text should be in active voice.</li>
        <li> <i>Avoid inappropriate language.</i> Keep words like "really, actually, pretty much" for social networks.</li>
        <li> <i>Avoid rare words and latinisms.</i> Non credo all readers know the meaning.</li>
        <li> <i>Keep abbreviations to minimum.</i> Abbreviations are hard to read, consider just spelling it out.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Beside these and many smaller rules, Angry Reviewer checks for typical typographic mistakes like spaces between a number and its units, references to Figures and Supplementary materials, chemical elements, abbreviations and other details. Full list of rules can be found the the source code in the <a href="https://github.com/anufrievroman/Angry-Reviewer">github repository</a>.</p>
