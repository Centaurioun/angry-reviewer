## Using standalone version
1. If you want to run the program on your own computer, download the *angry_reviewer_standalone.py* file and change the path to your text document at the beginning of this file. You can use any plain text documents, like .txt, .tex, .md, but not .doc or other rich text files. For example, if the *angry_reviewer_standalone.py* and your text are in the same folder, simply change the first line as:

```
YOUR_FILE = "my_file.txt"
```

2. Run the pyton file with Python 3. The code will output corrections in the terminal window as well as in the output file *corrections.txt*.
