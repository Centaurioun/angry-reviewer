The rules used by Angry Reviewer are based on various journal guidelines, articles, books, and lectures on modern academic writing. But, the main source is the book *The Craft of Scientific Writing* by Michael Alley. The alghorithm knows hundreds of rules, most of which are stylistic. For the spell check you should rely on your text editor and other services.

## Main priciples

- Don't hype. Avoid words like novel, highly, clearly, greatly. Better still, avoid all adverbs.
- Don't use clich√©s. Avoid overused expressions like holy grail, paradigm shift, in a nutshell.
- Don't use "very" very often. Usually, there is a better word for it.
- Be concise. Avoid phrases like by means of, despite the fact that, in order to.
- Avoid negatives. For example, use "unable" instead of "not able".
- Avoid redundancy. For example, use "investigate" instead of "conduct an investigation of".
- Use active voice. Although not always possible, most of the text should be in active voice.
- Avoid inappropriate language. Keep words like "really, actually, pretty much" for social networks.
- Avoid rare words and latinisms. Non credo all readers know the meaning.
- Keep abbreviations to minimum. Abbreviations are hard to read, consider just spelling it out.

Beside these and many smaller rules, Angry Reviewer checks for typical typographic mistakes like spaces between a number and its units, references to Figures and Supplementary materials, chemical elements, abbreviations. If you supply LaTeX text, it can also check your references for self-citation, overcitation, number of references, length of abstract and title, and other LaTeX specific issues.
