\significancestatement{As overheating limits the performance of highly integrated electronics, new heat transfer mechanisms are expected to solve this problem. We propose surface phonon-polaritons(SPhPs) as such new heat carriers. Theoretically, SPhPs can carry heat ballistically for hundreds of micrometers, which is thousands of times longer than typical travel distance of phonons. Here, we systematically measured the thermal conductivity of nanomembranes. Our measurements showed that the SPhPs conduction becomes stronger as membranes become thinner and as the temperature increased. Remarkably, we demonstrate for the first time that the ballistic propagation of SPhPs can be over hundreds of micrometers, moreover, the possibility for coherent heat manipulation in macroscale. Thus, we believe this work contributes to the development of electronics with efficient heat dissipation.}

\begin{abstract}
Efficient heat dissipation in micro/nano electronics requires ballistic propagation of heat carriers operated above room temperature. 
However, thermal phonons---the primary heat carriers in dielectric nanomaterials---dissipate the thermal energy after just a few hundred nanometers.
Theory predicts that surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs) can carry thermal energy ballistically for hundreds of micrometers, which may improve the overall dissipation of heat in nanomaterials. 
In this work, we experimentally demonstrate such long-distance heat transport by SPhPs. 
Using the 3$\omega$ technique, we measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN nanomembranes for different heater-sensor distances, membrane thicknesses, and temperatures.
We find that thin nanomembranes support heat transport by SPhPs, as evidenced by an increase in the thermal conductivity with temperature.
Remarkably, the thermal conductivity measured 200 $\mu$m away from the heater is consistently higher than that measured 100 $\mu$m closer.
This result suggests that heat conduction by SPhPs is ballistic over at least hundreds of micrometers.
Thus, our findings pave the way for coherent heat manipulations above room temperature over macroscopic distances, which impacts the applications in thermal management and polaritonics.

\dropcap{H}eat conduction in semiconductors is essentially governed by the mean free path of heat carriers.
In nanomaterials of the size comparable to the mean free path, heat conduction can even happen ballistically \cite{Yang2021, Anufriev2018a, Vakulov2020}, without dissipation of thermal energy, which could be used for heat dissipation in microelectronics \cite{pop2010energy}.
However, even in silicon membranes, the mean free path of phonons at room temperature is as short as 30 -- 300 nm \cite{Anufriev2020, Malhotra2016}, which only becomes shorter at higher temperatures \cite{Regner2013}.
Such short propagation length makes it unfeasible to attain the ballistic regime in the micro-sized dielectric materials used in modern electronics.
Therefore, heat carriers with a longer propagation length are desirable.

Over the past two decades, the propagation, detection, and energy transport of surface electromagnetic waves has attracted attention due to the predominance of surface effects over the volumetric ones in nanostructures with high surface-to-volume ratio \cite{thompson2018hundred}.
Certain types of surface electromagnetic waves may even carry heat \cite{joulain_surface_2005,chen_measurement_2007,chen_heat_2010,baffou_mapping_2010} and thus improve the thermal performance and stability of nanoscale devices \cite{mulet_nanoscale_2001,dusastre_materials_2017,biswas_high-performance_2012}.
One type of such waves is the surface phonon-polaritons (SPhPs)---evanescent surface waves generated by the coupling of photons with optical phonons \cite{chen_surface_2005, ordonez-miranda_anomalous_2013,lin2017all, greffet_coherent_2002,francoeur_local_2010,rivera2017making}.
Theoretical works predict that SPhPs can propagate along the surface of polar dielectric materials without dissipation for hundreds of micrometers \cite{ordonez-miranda_thermal_2014, nano10071383}, which is orders of magnitude longer than the typical mean free path of phonons.
Moreover, recent experiments demonstrated that in thin membranes, SPhPs can even carry heat at least as efficiently as phonons \cite{wu2020enhanced,tranchant_two-dimensional_2019}.
However, the long-distance ballistic conduction remains to be experimentally demonstrated.

In this work, we aim to demonstrate ballistic heat transport via SPhPs over hundreds of micrometers.
Our experiments compare the thermal conductivity of SiN membranes measured 100 and 200 $\mu$m away from the heater.
Assuming that phonon transport in amorphous membranes is purely diffusive at these length scales \cite{Tambo2020}, any difference in the measured thermal conductivity can only be explained by the presence of additional heat conduction channels.
Thus, by conducting the measurements for different heater-sensor distances, membrane thicknesses, and temperatures, we demonstrate how heat conduction by SPhPs occurs in thin membranes and remains ballistic for over hundreds of micrometers.

\section*{RESULTS}

To measure the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN membranes, we used the 3$\omega$ method \cite{cahill1987thermal,cahill1990thermal}.
Fig. \ref{Figure1}A illustrates the 3$\omega$ setup with four probes coupled to a heating stage and placed in a vacuum chamber.
To probe the thermal conductivity at different propagation distances, two sensor wires were placed 100 and 200 $\mu$m away from the heater wire, as shown in Figs. \ref{Figure1}B-C.
Figure \ref{Figure1}D illustrates how SPhPs are excited by the Joule effect in the heater wire.
The in-plane thermal conductivity was extracted by comparing the 3$\omega$ signal with an analytical model (Supplementary Note 2). 
Thermal radiation losses were taken into account as explained in Supplementary Note 2.

    \label{Figure1}
\end{figure*}

Figure \ref{Figure2}A reports the temperature dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN membranes of different thickness.
The data measured for the heater-sensor distances of 100 and 200 $\mu$m are joined by the dashed and solid lines and labelled as $\kappa_{100}$ and $\kappa_{200}$, respectively. 
The thickest membrane ($d$ = 200 nm) at 300 K has $\kappa_{100} \approx \kappa_{200} \approx 3.1$ Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$, which decreases by about 4\% at 400 K. 
This value of the thermal conductivity is consistent with our previous measurements \cite{wu2020enhanced}, and its reduction above room temperature is characteristic of the phonon thermal conductivity driven by the internal scattering processes of phonons.
Likewise, the thermal conductivity of the 100-nm-thick membrane is nearly independent of the heater-sensor distance and temperature.
The independence of the heater-sensor distance also indicates that the thermal transport is mainly driven by the phonons and thus is diffusive at this scale, as predicted by the theory \cite{ordonez-miranda_anomalous_2013}.

(B) In-plane thermal conductivity normalized by the values at 300 K.}
    \label{Figure2}
\end{figure}

Interestingly, the thermal conductivity of the two thinner membranes (30 and 50 nm) shows a significant 5$\%$ increase with temperature (shown in Fig. \ref{Figure2}B), which differs from that of the thicker ones.
For the 50-nm-thick membrane, $\kappa_{100}$ ($\kappa_{200}$) increases from 2.10 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ (2.20 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) at 300 K to 2.24 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ (2.29 Wm$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$) at 400 K.
For the 30-nm-thick membrane, this enhancement raises to 6.6\% and 12.4\% for the thermal conductivity values $\kappa_{100}$ and $\kappa_{200}$. 
The observed increase in the thermal conductivity with temperature is the sign of the heat conduction by SPhPs, as shown in our previous work \cite{wu2020enhanced}.
As SPhP contribution becomes stronger at higher temperatures, it compensates for the thermal conductivity reduction due to the phonon-phonon scattering, thus leading to the overall increase of the thermal conductivity with temperature.
This explains the difference in trends for thicker and thinner membranes.

Second, the thermal conductivity measured 200 $\mu$m away from the heater is higher than that measured 100 $\mu$m away ($\kappa_{200} > \kappa_{100}$).
Since the phonon transport is diffusive at such a long length scale \cite{Tambo2020}, we attribute the observed difference in the thermal conductivity to the ballistic heat conduction by SPhPs.
Indeed, length-dependent thermal conductivity is one of the signs of ballistic heat conduction \cite{anufriev2019probing, zhang2018thermal, Yang2021, Vakulov2020} and implies that heat carriers propagate ballistically at least as far as length dependence is measured.
Thus, the observations suggest that SPhPs can ballistically carry heat for at least 200 $\mu$m.

\section*{DISCUSSION}

To better understand the behaviour of the measured thermal conductivity, we analyze the SPhP contribution to the heat transport in SiN membranes. 
According to the Boltzmann transport equation, under the relaxation time approximation, the SPhP contribution to the in-plane thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{SPhP}}$) of a membrane of thickness $d$ is given by \cite{chen_surface_2005}:

\begin{equation}
\label{TC}
 \kappa_{\text{SPhP}} = \frac{1}{4\pi d}\int_{\omega_\text{L}}^{\omega_\text{H}}\hslash\omega\Lambda_\text{e}\beta_\text{R}\frac{\partial f_0}{\partial T}\text{d}\omega,
\end{equation}

where $\hslash$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\Lambda_\text{e}$ is the effective propagation length of SPhPs propagating along the membrane surface with a complex wavevector $\beta$, $\beta_\text{R}=\text{Re}(\beta)$, $f_0$ is the Bose-Einstein distribution function, $T$ is the average membrane temperature, and $\omega_\text{H}$ and $\omega_\text{L}$ stand for the highest and lowest frequencies supporting the propagation of SPhPs, respectively. 
Since heat generated by SPhPs inside a material is proportional to the imaginary part of its dielectric function \cite{baffou_mapping_2010}, this material property is strongly linked to these frequencies and hence $\kappa_{\text{SPhP}}$.

(B) Theoretical SPhP thermal conductivity as a function of the heater-sensor distance for four SiN membrane thicknesses at 300 and 400 K. The experimental result of 30-nm-thick membrane (red solid triangles) is in good agreement with theoretical values.}
\label{Figure3}
\end{figure*}

To take into account finite lateral size of our SiN membranes, their effective thermal conductivity is determined by Mathiessenâ€™s rule $\Lambda_\text{e}^{-1}=\Lambda^{-1}+L^{-1}$, where $\Lambda$ is the intrinsic propagation length of polaritons, and $L$ is the heater-sensor distance (100 and 200 $\mu$m). 
Thus, the values of $L$ are much shorter than those of $\Lambda$ ($\approx$ 1 m for SiN membranes \cite{wu2020enhanced}) and much longer than the intrinsic mean free path of phonons in amorphous materials \cite{pan2020quantifying, wingert_thermal_2016} around room temperature. 
Equation \ref{TC} thus establishes that the values of $\kappa_{\text{SPhP}}$ are determined by the SPhP dispersion relation $\beta(\omega)$ driven by the membrane dielectric function that usually changes with temperature and membrane thickness \cite{joulain_radiative_2015}.
However, for the thicknesses and temperatures considered in this work, the dielectric function of our SiN membranes is nearly independent of these parameters, as established by our previous optical measurements \cite{wu2020enhanced}.

Figure \ref{Figure3} shows the SPhP thermal conductivity predicted by Eq. \ref{TC} for different temperatures, heater-sensor distances, and membrane thicknesses.
Thinner and hotter membranes with longer heater-sensor distances exhibit higher SPhP thermal conductivity.
This behaviour is consistent with that reported for SiO$_2$ and SiC membranes \cite{chen_surface_2005, ordonez-miranda_anomalous_2013} and opposite to the typical behaviour of the phonon thermal conductivity.
Thus, it signals the SPhP contribution to the heat transport along the membranes.

For the thinnest membrane ($d$ = 30 nm), the measured thermal conductivity enhancement $\Delta\kappa_{\text{SPhP}} = \kappa(T) - \kappa(300 K)$ is in agreement with prediction of the model (Fig. \ref{Figure3}A). 
However, in thicker membranes ($d >$ 30 nm), the phonons make a significant contribution to heat conduction, and the discrepancy between measured (phonons and SPhPs) and theoretical (only SPhPs) values increases with membrane thickness. 
Remarkably, Fig. \ref{Figure3}B shows that theoretically, SPhPs can travel ballistically as far as one meter, and the values measured on the 30-nm-thick membrane follow the predicted trend.

In conclusion, we experimentally demonstrated long-distance heat conduction by SPhPs.
We measured the in-plane thermal conductivity of SiN membranes and showed that in thin membranes, the heat conduction is mainly driven by SPhPs.
Moreover, the measured thermal conductivity was higher when measured further away from the heater.
The observed difference in the thermal conductivity is attributed to ballistic heat conduction by SPhPs and is in agreement with our theoretical model.
Thus, our experimental results suggest that the SPhPs can carry heat ballistically over hundreds of micrometers, whereas our model predicts that it is far from the limit.
Considering that the coherence length is comparable to the propagation length \cite{greffet2002coherent}, promising outcomes are expected via coherent. 
This work lays the foundations for improving the heat dissipation in microelectronics and efficiency in silicon photonics.

\section*{Materials and Methods}

\subsection*{Sample fabrication}

Samples of amorphous SiN membranes with thicknesses of 30, 50, 100, and 200 nm were suspended in a $1 \times 1$ mm$^2$ square windows on Si substrates as shown in Fig. \ref{Figure4}A. 
These high-stress ($\approx$ 250 MPa) membranes were flat (curvature radius of 4 m) to ensure an ideal measurement for the long-range SPhP propagation. 
Gold wires of 4 $\mu$m in width and 100 nm in height, serving the heater and the sensors (Supplementary Fig. S1), were deposited on the membranes using laser lithography and electron beam assisted physical deposition (Ulvac EX-300). 
A layer of 10-nm-thick Cr was deposited between Au and SiN to enhance the adhesion. 

\subsection*{Thermal conductivity measurements}

The in-plane thermal conductivity measurements were carried out using the 3$\omega$ method with a low-noise AC source (Lakeshore AC155) supplying the modulated current $I=I_0\text{cos}(\omega t)=I_0\text{Re}(\text{e}^{i\omega t})$ in a thin Cr/Au micro-resistor (Fig. \ref{Figure4}B).
The supplied current caused the temperature increase d$T_{\text{h}}$ calculated from the $3\omega$ voltage measured with a lock-in amplifier in a half-bridge configuration.
A programmable analogue resistance $R_\text{hp}$ canceled the excessive 1$\omega$ signal at the input of the lock-in, enabling a higher sensitivity range for detecting the 3$\omega$ signal.
The heat flux propagated from the heater to the sensor resistance $R_\text{s}$, leading to a temperature rise d$T_\text{s}$, which was calculated from the $2\omega$ signal detected with another lock-in amplifier in a DC Wheatstone bridge. 
All analogue resistances had a temperature coefficient of resistance below 5 ppm/K. 
The holder temperature was controlled (Lakeshore 335) in the 300 -- 400 K range ($+/-$ 10 mK). 
The measurements were operated in a vacuum probe station (JANIS ST-500-1) with a typical vacuum level of $5 \times 10^{-6}$ mbar (Pfeiffer Hi-Cube 80). 

A Labview program was developed to fully automate the parameter sweeps (holder temperature, heater frequency $w/2\pi$, heater amplitude $i_{\omega}$, sensor DC $I_{\text{dc}}$) with an auto-adjustment of lock-in amplifiers sensitivity according to the signals levels. 
These time-dependent signals were continuously recorded for ten minutes for each experimental condition, except in the case of holder temperature changes, where the stabilization time was one hour.
Preliminary annealing at 450 K for twelve hours was performed in a vacuum before the measurements.
The annealing allowed stabilizing the intrinsic properties of the Cr/Au micro-resistances and contribute to linear temperature coefficients of resistance obtained for both $R_{\text{h}}$ and $R_{\text{s}}$, typically 1000 times higher than the temperature coefficient of resistance of any analogue resistance in the circuits.
