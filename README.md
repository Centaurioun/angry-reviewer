# StyleCorrector
Stylistic corrector for academic writing and scientific papers.

## Usage
1. Download the corrector.py file and change the path to your text document (you can use any plain text document, e.g. .txt, .tex, .md) at the beginning of this file. For example, if the corrector.py and your text are in the same folder simply write:

```
path = "MyText.txt"
```

2. Run the code using Python 3. The code will output corrections in the terminal window as well as in the output file "corrections.txt".
